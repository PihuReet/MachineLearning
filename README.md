Sample 1: PricePrediction.py

To run this example first download sample data files. And change the path accordingly. In this example I've used LotArea, 
OverallQual, YearBuilt, TotRmsAbvGrd these columns as a feture columns to train the model.

Have used Pandas library to read and write files. <b>sklearn</b> library for RandomForestRegressor regression model. 

It creates a file, submission.csv with predicted price for each row in test.csv file.
