Sample 1: PricePrediction.py

To run this example first download sample data files. And change the path accordingly. In this example I've used <b>LotArea, 
OverallQual, YearBuilt, TotRmsAbvGrd </b> these columns as a parameter columns to <b>train</b> the model.

Have used <b>Pandas</b> library to read and write files. <b>sklearn</b> library for <b>RandomForestRegressor</b> regression model. 

It creates a file, <b>submission.csv</b> with predicted price for each row in test.csv file.
